            <h3><span id="digimonDescription">A  Reptile Digimon with an appearance resembling a small dinosaur, it has grown and become able to walk on two legs. Its strength is weak as it is still in the process of growing, but it has a fearless and rather ferocious personality. Hard, sharp claws grow from both its hands and feet, and their power is displayed in battle. It also foreshadows an evolution into a great and powerful Digimon. Its Special Move is spitting a fiery breath from its mouth to attack the opponent (Baby Flame).</span></h3>
